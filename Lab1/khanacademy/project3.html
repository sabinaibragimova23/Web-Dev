        <h6>Posted on January 24, 2026</h6>
        
        <p>Today I started my blog! I'm excited to document my journey in learning web development. I'll share tips, tricks, and what I've built along the way.</p>
        

        <h2 id="post2">Learning HTML & CSS</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 25, 2026</h6>
        
        <p>Yesterday, I learned how to structure webpages with HTML and style them using CSS. It's amazing how a few lines of code can change the look of a page completely!</p>
        
        <p>Next, I want to experiment with tables, links, and images to make my blog more interactive and visually appealing.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="post3">Studying OOP</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 26, 2026</h6>
        
        <p>Today I started learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It's really interesting how I can create classes and objects to organize my code more efficiently.</p>
        
        <p>I learned about <strong>inheritance</strong>, <strong>methods</strong>, and <strong>attributes</strong>. I can't wait to build small projects using OOP concepts to solidify my understanding!</p>
